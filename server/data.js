                  `What is a blockchain?

                  A blockchain is literally a chain of blocks. In other words, it's a data structure where each block contains a reference to the previous block, some data, and a secure digital fingerprint known as a _hash._
                  
                  To generate a hash, a block is run though a cryptographic hash function that outputs a fixed length alphanumeric string. This hash is placed into the next block, so that it has a reference back to the previous block's hash. If any part of a block is mutated after it's been created, the hash would also change. Therefore, all subsequent blocks would contain an incorrect previous hash. This is the fundamental idea behind a blockchain. It is _immutable._
