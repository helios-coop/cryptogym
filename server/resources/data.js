In other words, it's just a data structure where each block contains a reference to the previous block, some data, and a secure digital fingerprint known as a _hash._\n\nTo generate a hash, a block is run though a cryptographic hash function that outputs a fixed length alphanumeric string. This hash is placed into the next block, so that it has a reference back to the previous block's hash. If any part of a block is mutated after it's been created, the hash would also change. Therefore, all subsequent blocks would contain an incorrect previous hash. This is the fundamental idea behind a blockchain. It is _immutable._ \n\n Initialize a variable called <code>blocks</code> to an empty array.`,

                text:`##Hashes\nThe block hash is one of the most important property of the block. The hash is calculated over all data of the block. This means that if anything in the block changes, the original hash is no longer valid. The block hash can also be thought as the unique identifier of the block. For instance, blocks with same index can appear, but they all have unique hashes.
                We calculate the hash of the block using the following code: const calculateHash = (index: number, previousHash: string, timestamp: number, data: string): string =>
                    <code>CryptoJS.SHA256(index + previousHash + timestamp + data).toString();</code>
                It should be noted that the block hash has not yet nothing to do with mining, as there is no proof-of-work problem to solve. We use block hashes to preserve integrity of the block and to explicitly reference the previous block.
                An important consequence of the properties hash and previousHash is that a block can’t be modified without changing the hash of every consecutive block.
                This is demonstrated in the example below. If the data in block 44 is changed from “DESERT” to “STREET”, all hashes of the consecutive blocks must be changed. This is because the hash of the block depends on the value of the previousHash (among other things).`,
